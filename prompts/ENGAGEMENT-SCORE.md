# Prompt: Engagement score definition

Ask the assistant:
"What strategy do you want to 'balance' teams?
- By player count only
- By engagement/activity (e.g., points, messages, active days, etc.)
- Mixed (count + engagement)."

The assistant should:
- Explain each option in a few sentences.
- Suggest a simple scoring formula if the engagement option is chosen.
- Propose a basic scoring example:

engagement_score = days_active_last_30
+ historical_events_participated
+ current_streak_value

- Justify that the formula is clear and understandable to the players.
