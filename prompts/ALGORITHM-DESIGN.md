# Prompt: Problem Statement

I need to redistribute gaming players into balanced teams.

I have data for `player_id`, `level`, `games_played`, and `last_active`.

What algorithm would be most fair and efficient for distributing players into T teams?
Consider that it should be deterministic and the community should view it as equitable.
